\section{ Test Scenarios and Study Region}

We tested the proposed method on four different idealized domains and a real heterogenous domain. The idealized domains are homogeneous and layered. Figure.~\ref{fig:3d_domain_scenarios}  represents these domains.

Testing of the proposed method is inspired from checker board test idea from inversion studies (add some references). We develop an artificial domain with  known damping parameters, and using the observed data at each stations we search for the initial used parameters. The real heterogeneous region  has greater Los angeles area and also it includes many small basins in different parts. Numerous earthquake recorded in this area and different studies is conducted from different perspective.  Several velocity models are developed and it in an going process \citep[e.g., see][]{small2017scec}. Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_stations} shows the  heterogeneous domain and stations location.

In order to test the methodology with real observational data, we use 2008 $Mw~5.4$  ChinoHills earthquake as an observation platform. Chino Hills earthquake is recored in more than 300 stations. however we only use the strong motion center stations, where in our study simulation box there are 262 stations.  Table.~\ref{tab:event_details}  and Table. ~\ref{tab:sim_param} represent the event and simulation details, respectively.
